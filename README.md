## Branching Strategy

This project follows the Trunk Based Development approach. Here are some guidelines:

### Main Branch

- The `main` branch is the primary branch from which all new branches are created and where they are merged back after development.
- All changes to the `main` branch are made via Pull Requests to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- The `main` branch is always deployable and is the source of truth for the current state of the project.

### Feature Branches

- For every new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the latest `main` branch.
- Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature/add-car-detail-page` or `fix/issue-with-charging-info`.
- Keep branches short-lived and merge them back into the `main` branch frequently after the work is complete and tested.

### Pull Requests

- When you're ready to merge your feature branch, submit a Pull Request to the `main` branch.
- Ensure that your Pull Request passes all continuous integration checks and gets the required approvals (if applicable) before merging.
- Once merged, it's safe to delete the feature branch.

- Once merged, it's safe to delete the feature branch.

### Hotfixes

- Hotfixes are treated as high-priority feature branches.
- Create a branch prefixed with `hotfix/`, make the necessary fixes, and submit a Pull Request back to `main`.

### Releases

- Releases are cut directly from the `main` branch.
- Use semantic versioning to tag releases, for example, `v1.0.0`.

By adhering to this strategy, we maintain a clean and manageable repository that enables continuous integration and delivery.
